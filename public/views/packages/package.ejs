            <h2>What we have to offer</h2>
            <p>By default, all of our websites are fully responsive, accessible, and mobile/touch friendly, but what if you don't need a corporate level application?</p>
            <p>We understand what it means to be a small business. It can overwhelmingly expensive to hire a professional to come in and provide you with a custom solution. This is where our statically priced packages come in</p>
            <p>These packages geared towards local or up-and-coming businesses seek to provide all the ammenities you come to expect from a modern website, without forcing you to take out a second morgage. With each of the packages below you can browse through our example applications. Check out the price points and if you find an example this is close in complexity/size to what you need, that is the price that you will pay</p>
